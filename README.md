# WeissSchwarzSimulator
A brute force simulator for card game Weiss Schwarz. 

Weiss Schwarz is in general a fairly complex card game with many probabilities involved, given specific sets of game actions within the game, this simulator calculates the probabilities of certain outcomes by replicating game mechanic exactly (hence "simulating"). Using results from this program, players are able to determine the potency of certain cards in given situations.

Currently, only supports "level-up" and "refresh" mechanics, basic command line interface available, more features to be added.
